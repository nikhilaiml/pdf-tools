# PDF Tool Website - Blueprint

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development of a comprehensive, no-login, all-in-one PDF tools website. The primary goal is to provide a fast, private, and user-friendly experience for processing PDF files. The website will offer a wide range of tools for merging, splitting, converting, editing, and securing PDFs. All uploaded and processed files will be automatically deleted to ensure user privacy.

## 2. Core Constraints

*   **No Login/Signup:** The service will be fully anonymous.
*   **No AI Features:** The focus is on PDF manipulation, not content analysis.
*   **No OTP, phone, or email usage**
*   **Temporary File Storage:** All files will be automatically deleted after a short period.
*   **PDF-Focused:** The toolset will be exclusively for PDF-related tasks.
*   **Auto-delete uploaded & processed files**

## 3. Target Audience

*   Students (assignments, projects)
*   Office & corporate users
*   Freelancers
*   Non-technical users

## 4. Implemented Features, Style, and Design

This section will be updated as the project progresses to reflect the current state of the application.

### Phase 1: UI & Static Foundation (In Progress)

*   **Homepage:** A clean and modern landing page introducing the PDF tools.
*   **Tool Listing:** A comprehensive list of all available tools, categorized for easy navigation.
*   **Tool Cards:** Each tool is represented by a card with an icon and a brief description.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website will be fully responsive and accessible on all devices.
*   **Styling:** The UI will be built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a minimal design with a professional color scheme.
